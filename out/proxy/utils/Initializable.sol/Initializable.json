Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"stateVariables\":{\"_initialized\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\"},\"_initializing\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"src/libraries/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable-master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"cancun\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":800},\"remappings\":[\":@ensdomains/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/node_modules/@ensdomains/\",\":@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/\",\":@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/\",\":@uniswap/v4-core/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/\",\":ds-test/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/\",\":erc4626-tests/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/lib/erc4626-tests/\",\":forge-gas-snapshot/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/lib/forge-gas-snapshot/src/\",\":forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/\",\":hardhat/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/node_modules/hardhat/\",\":openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/\",\":permit2/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/permit2/\",\":solmate/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/lib/solmate/\",\":v4-core/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/src/\",\":v4-periphery/=lib/v4-periphery/\"],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"src/libraries/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable-master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8b2abd85d0ece7e866e100e9d47ca9cbec93c87cf71a8d267b2b93eb81f7d5e9\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://fe9fa1beb63e4a09637701f783982ba80380d630d600c9cafe26b68bf58be1b2\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmRA3GXhTWys88joD9x8xYhdjzvGwmDGLMMzGw3LxbSEge\"]}},\"version\":1}","metadata":{"compiler":{"version":"0.8.26+commit.8a97fa7a"},"language":"Solidity","output":{"abi":[],"devdoc":{"kind":"dev","methods":{},"version":1},"userdoc":{"kind":"user","methods":{},"version":1}},"settings":{"remappings":["@ensdomains/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/node_modules/@ensdomains/","@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/","@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/","@uniswap/v4-core/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/","ds-test/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/","erc4626-tests/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/lib/erc4626-tests/","forge-gas-snapshot/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/lib/forge-gas-snapshot/src/","forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/","hardhat/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/node_modules/hardhat/","openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/","permit2/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/permit2/","solmate/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/lib/solmate/","v4-core/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core/src/","v4-periphery/=lib/v4-periphery/"],"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":800},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"compilationTarget":{"src/libraries/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable-master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":"Initializable"},"evmVersion":"cancun","libraries":{},"viaIR":true},"sources":{"src/libraries/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable-master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":{"keccak256":"0x8b2abd85d0ece7e866e100e9d47ca9cbec93c87cf71a8d267b2b93eb81f7d5e9","urls":["bzz-raw://fe9fa1beb63e4a09637701f783982ba80380d630d600c9cafe26b68bf58be1b2","dweb:/ipfs/QmRA3GXhTWys88joD9x8xYhdjzvGwmDGLMMzGw3LxbSEge"],"license":"MIT"}},"version":1},"id":390}
